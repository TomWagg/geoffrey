Using first-year Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) repeated spectroscopy of nearly 29,000 previously known active galactic nuclei (AGNs), combined with dedicated follow-up spectroscopy, and publicly available optical light curves, we have identified 116 CL-AGNs where (at least) one broad emission line has essentially (dis-)appeared, as well as 88 other extremely variable systems. Our CL-AGN sample, with 107 newly identified cases, is the largest reported to date, and includes ∼0.4% of the AGNs reobserved in first-year SDSS-V operations. Among our CL-AGNs, 67% exhibit dimming while 33% exhibit brightening. Our sample probes extreme AGN spectral variability on months to decades timescales, including some cases of recurring transitions on surprisingly short timescales (≲2 months in the rest frame). We find that CL events are preferentially found in lower-Eddington-ratio (f <SUB>Edd</SUB>) systems: Our CL-AGNs have a f <SUB>Edd </SUB>distribution that significantly differs from that of a carefully constructed, redshift- and luminosity-matched control sample (Anderson–Darling test yielding p <SUB>AD</SUB> ≈ 6 × 10<SUP>‑5</SUP>; median f <SUB>Edd</SUB> ≈ 0.025 versus 0.043). This preference for low f <SUB>Edd</SUB> strengthens previous findings of higher CL-AGN incidence at lower f <SUB>Edd</SUB>, found in smaller samples.

Generally, luminous AGNs (i.e., quasars) exhibit ""positive"" evolution. This means that, on average, quasars are more numerous and/or more luminous in the early Universe, at higher redshifts, than they are today. However, the evolution of BL Lacs has been long disputed, in part due to selection biases and small sample sizes. Here we perform the luminosity–volume test of BL Lac evolution on a uniformly selected sample and find that BL Lacs instead exhibit mild negative evolution.

Our sample includes disk lags that are both longer and shorter than predicted by the Shakura and Sunyaev model, requiring explanations that satisfy both cases. Although our quasars each have one lag measurement, we explore the wavelength-dependent effects of diffuse broad-line region (BLR) contamination through our sample's broad redshift range, 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.2. We do not find significant evidence of variable diffuse Fe II and Balmer nebular emission in the rms spectra, nor from Anderson-Darling tests of quasars in redshift ranges with and without diffuse nebular emission falling in the observed-frame filters. Contrary to previous work, we do not detect a significant correlation between the measured continuum and BLR lags in our luminous quasar sample, similarly suggesting that our continuum lags are not dominated by diffuse nebular emission. Similar to other studies, we find that quasars with larger-than-expected continuum lags have lower 3000 Å luminosities, and we additionally find longer continuum lags with lower X-ray luminosities and black hole masses. Our lack of evidence for diffuse BLR contribution to the lags indicates that the anticorrelation between continuum lag and luminosity is not likely to be due to the Baldwin effect. Instead, these anticorrelations favor models in which the continuum lag increases in lower-luminosity active galactic nuclei, including scenarios featuring magnetic coupling between the accretion disk and X-ray corona, and/or ripples or rims in the disk.",False,1

We use the VPLanet model to simulate the evolution of the L 98-59 system and the atmospheric escape of its inner three small planets, given different assumed initial water quantities.

We use the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream to perform a comprehensive search at optical wavelengths for previously undiscovered outbursting LMXBs. Our pipeline first crossmatches the positions of the alerts to cataloged X-ray sources, and then analyzes the 30 day lightcurve of matched alerts by thresholding on differences with an 8 day exponentially weighted moving average.

Based on the SED fitting, we obtained a bimodal posterior distribution of primary stellar masses with a stronger preference for a 1.5 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> mass star. Within the last 66 yr of photometric coverage, no other significant dimming events of this depth and duration were identified in the optical light curves. Using a Gaussian process, we fit a generalized Gaussian distribution to the optical and IR light curves and conclude that the dimming event exhibits moderate asymmetries from optical to IR. At the minimum of the dimming event, the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer color (W1-W2) differed by ~0.2 mag relative to the primary star color outside the dimming event. The ingress and egress colors show a shallow reddening profile. We suggest that the main culprit of the dimming event is likely due to the presence of a large, optically thick disk transiting the primary giant star. By fitting a monochromatic transit model of an oblate disk transiting a star, we found good agreement with a slow-moving (0.005 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) disk with a ~1.4 au radius.

To accomplish this, Rubin will use out-of-focus images from sensors located at the edge of the focal plane to learn and correct for perturbations to the wave front. We have designed and integrated a deep-learning (DL) model for wave-front estimation into the AOS pipeline. In this paper, we compare the performance of this DL approach to Rubin's baseline algorithm when applied to images from two different simulations of the Rubin optical system.

Compared to the baseline algorithm, the DL model is 40× faster, the median error 2× better under ideal conditions, 5× better in the presence of vignetting by the Rubin camera, and 14× better in the presence of blending in crowded fields. In addition, the DL model surpasses the required optical quality in simulations of the AOS closed loop. This system promises to increase the survey area useful for precision science by up to 8%.

Characterizing transits on an individual, rather than phase-folded, basis is much more challenging due to the often low signal-to-noise ratio of lightcurves, missing data, and low sampling rates.

In particular, these systems may contain exozodiacal dust, which is expected to be the dominant source of astrophysical noise. Previous work has shown that it may be feasible to subtract smooth, symmetric dust from observations; however, we do not expect exozodiacal dust to be perfectly smooth. Exozodiacal dust can be trapped into mean-motion resonances with planetary bodies, producing large-scale structures that orbit in lock with the planet. This dust can obscure the planet, complicate noise estimation, or be mistaken for a planetary body. Our ability to subtract these structures from high-contrast images of Earth-like exoplanets is not well understood. In this work, we investigate exozodi mitigation for Earth-Sun-like systems with significant mean-motion resonant disk structures. We find that applying a simple high-pass filter allows us to remove structured exozodi to the Poisson noise limit for systems with inclinations &lt;60° and up to 100 zodis. However, subtracting exozodiacal disk structures from edge-on systems may be challenging, except for cases with densities &lt;5 zodis. For systems with three times the dust of the solar system, which is the median of the best fit to survey data in the habitable zones of nearby Sun-like stars, this method shows promising results for mitigating exozodiacal dust in future Habitable Worlds Observatory observations, even if the dust exhibits significant mean-motion resonance structure.",True,2

This brings a new way to understand the connection between the formation of binary SMBHs and galaxy formation if we can connect theoretical models with multimessenger observations namely GW data and galaxy surveys. Along these lines, we present here the first paper on this series based on ROMULUS25 cosmological simulation on the properties of the host galaxies of SMBHs and propose on how this can be used to connect with observations of nano-Hertz GW signal and galaxy surveys.

In this work, we introduce a new approach: the Cold Gas Subgrid Model (CGSM), which models unresolved cold gas as a second fluid in addition to the standard ''normal'' gas fluid. The CGSM tracks the total mass density and bulk momentum of unresolved cold gas, deriving the properties of its unresolved cloudlets from the resolved gas phase. The interactions between the subgrid cold fluid and the resolved fluid are modeled by prescriptions from high-resolution simulations of ''cloud crushing'' and thermal instability. Through a series of idealized tests, we demonstrate the CGSM's ability to overcome the resolution limitations of traditional hydrodynamics simulations, successfully capturing the correct cold gas mass, its spatial distribution, and the timescales for cloud destruction and growth.

In this work, we use direct N-body simulations to explore and understand the growth of planetary embryos from planetesimals in disks extending down to ≃1 day orbital periods. We show that planetesimal accretion becomes nearly 100% efficient at short orbital periods, leading to embryo masses that are much larger than the classical isolation mass. For rocky bodies, the physical size of the object begins to occupy a significant fraction of its Hill sphere toward the inner edge of the disk. In this regime, most close encounters result in collisions, rather than scattering, and the system does not develop a bimodal population of dynamically hot planetesimals and dynamically cold oligarchs, as is seen in previous studies. The highly efficient accretion seen at short orbital periods implies that systems of tightly packed inner planets should be almost completely devoid of any residual small bodies.

The implication is that a majority of its metals originated in a single extremely metal-poor nucleosynthetic source.

SDSS-IV collaboration members are twice as likely to have a parent with a college degree, than the general population, and are ten times more likely to have a parent with a PhD. This trend is slightly enhanced for female collaboration members. Despite this, the fraction of first generation college students is significant (31%).

One indicator of a binary progenitor is that the surrounding stellar population is too old to contain a massive single star.

Applying the combined constraints to population synthesis models, we determine that the probability of the progenitor of SN 2017eaw being an initially single star is 65% compared to 35% for prior binary interaction. 85.9 Myr is inconsistent with any formation scenarios. We demonstrate that combining progenitor age constraints with helium-core mass estimates from red supergiant SED modeling, late-time spectra, and indirectly from light-curve modeling can help to differentiate single and binary progenitor scenarios and provide a framework for the application of this technique to future observations.",False,2

AM Her shows a variety of high states with frequent transitions between them. TESS photometry of AR UMa in the low state reveals no evidence of accretion, while the McDonald 2.1 m telescope caught AR UMa in its high accretion state. Roche-lobe overflow is shut off during low states of AR UMa, while accretion often still takes place during low states of AM Her. We derive inclinations of 50° and 70° for AM Her and AR UMa respectively. To model the high-state light curves of AM Her, we employ a self-organized map light-curve classification scheme to establish common accretion configurations. The cyclotron radiation properties then allow the production of emission region maps on the surface of the white dwarf. The accretion geometry of AM Her is most consistent with a multipolar field structure. The high-state photometry of AR UMa has stochastic accretion flaring, which we attribute to magnetically buffeted mass transfer through the inner Lagrangian point L1. To consider this possibility, we examine the magnetism of both stars and argue that the local magnetic field near L1 can initiate short-lived accretion events and affect transitions between high and low accretion states in both AM Her and AR UMa. In particular, AR UMa has the low state as its default, while AM Her and most other active polars are in the high state by default.",False,1

K2BS5 clearly meets the criteria for an SU UMa star, but at the peak of the superoutburst, it also shows double-wave oscillations consistent with the spectroscopic orbital period, a phenomenon that closely resembles early superhumps in WZ Sge stars.

V844 Her is an SU UMa type cataclysmic variable with an orbital period of 78.69 minutes, near the period minimum. The frequency of this new signal is constant in contrast to the superhump oscillations commonly seen in SU UMa outbursts. We searched without success for oscillations during quiescence using MDM, TESS, and XMM-Newton data. The lack of a periodic signal in the XMM light curve and the relatively low X-ray luminosity of V844 Her suggest that it is not a typical IP. We consider the possibility that the 29-minute signal is the result of super-Nyquist sampling of a dwarf nova oscillation with a period near the 2-minute cadence of the TESS data. Our analysis of archival AAVSO photometry from a 2006 super-outburst supports the existence of a 29-minute oscillation, although a published study of an earlier super-outburst did not detect the signal. We compare the X-ray properties of V844 Her with short orbital period intermediate polars (IP), V1025 Cen and DW Cnc. We conclude that the new signal is a real photometric oscillation coming from the V844 Her system and that it is unlikely to be an aliased high-frequency oscillation. The steady frequency of the new signal suggests that its origin is related to an asynchronously rotating white dwarf in V844 Her, although the precise mechanism producing the flux variations remains unclear.",False,1

The extended regulator model provides an analytic framework for the resulting variability (or ""burstiness"") in galaxy-wide star formation due to these processes. It does this by relating the variability in Fourier space to the effective timescales of stochastic gas inflow, equilibrium, and dynamical processes influencing giant molecular clouds' creation and destruction using the power spectral density (PSD) formalism. We use the connection between the PSD and autocovariance function for general stochastic processes to reformulate this model as an autocovariance function, which we use to model variability in galaxy star formation histories (SFHs) using physically motivated Gaussian processes in log star formation rate (SFR) space. Using stellar population synthesis models, we then explore how changes in model stochasticity can affect spectral signatures across galaxy populations with properties similar to the Milky Way and present-day dwarfs, as well as at higher redshifts. We find that, even at fixed scatter, perturbations to the stochasticity model (changing timescales vs. overall variability) leave unique spectral signatures across both idealized and more realistic galaxy populations. Distributions of spectral features including Hα and UV-based SFR indicators, Hδ and Ca H and K absorption-line strengths, D <SUB> n </SUB>(4000), and broadband colors provide testable predictions for galaxy populations from present and upcoming surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

An important open question is whether massive stars found in diffuse regions outside spiral arms formed in situ or migrated there after forming in denser environments. To address this question, we use multiresolution measurements of extinction in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) to probe the interstellar medium surrounding massive stars across galactic environments. We construct a catalog of 42,107 main-sequence massive star candidates (M ≥ 8 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) using resolved stellar photometry from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) program, plus stellar and dust model fits from the Bayesian Extinction and Stellar Tool (BEAST). We quantify galactic environments by computing surrounding stellar densities of massive stars using kernel density estimation. We then compare high-resolution line-of-sight extinction estimates from the BEAST with 25 pc resolution dust maps from PHAT, measuring the total column density distribution of extinction. Our key finding is that, although the average total column density of dust increases with the density of massive stars, the average line-of-sight extinction toward massive stars remains constant across all environments. This suggests that massive stars have a uniform amount of dust in their immediate environment, regardless of their location in the galaxy. One possible explanation for these findings is that small molecular clouds are still capable of forming massive stars, even if they are not resolvable at 25 pc. These results indicate that massive stars are forming in the sparse regions of M31, as opposed to migrating there.",False,1

These methods typically rely on parameterized potential models of the Galaxy and must take into account nontrivial survey selection effects, because they make use of the density of stars in phase space. Large-scale spectroscopic surveys now supply information beyond kinematics in the form of precise stellar label measurements (especially element abundances). These element abundances are known to correlate with orbital actions or other dynamical invariants. Here, we use the Orbital Torus Imaging framework that uses abundance gradients in phase space to map orbits. In many cases these gradients can be measured without detailed knowledge of the selection function. We use stellar surface abundances from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment survey combined with kinematic data from the Gaia mission. Our method reveals the vertical (z-direction) orbital structure in the Galaxy and enables empirical measurements of the vertical acceleration field and orbital frequencies in the disk. From these measurements, we infer the total surface mass density, Σ, and midplane volume density, ρ <SUB>0</SUB>, as a function of Galactocentric radius and height.

We quantify both the concentration of the more recent star formation in the Galactic plane, and the age-related increase in the scale height of the Galactic disc stellar component, which is well-described by power laws with indices ranging from 1/2 to 2/3. The vertically-integrated star formation rate falls from $(1.147 \pm 0.039)\times 10^{-8}\, \text{M}_\odot \, \text{yr}^{-1} \, \text{pc}^{-2}$ at earlier times down to $(6.2 \pm 3.0) \times 10^{-9}\, \text{M}_\odot \, \text{yr}^{-1} \, \text{pc}^{-2}$ at present times, but we find a significant peak of star formation in the 2-3 Gyr age bin. The total mass of stars formed per unit area over time is $118.7 \pm 6.2\, \text{M}_\odot \, \text{pc}^{-2}$, which is nearly twice the present stellar mass derived from kinematics within 1 kpc from the Galactic plane, implying a high degree of matter recycling in successive generations of stars. The method is then modified by adopting an age-dependent correlation between the SFH across the different slices, which results in less noisy and more symmetrical results without significantly changing the previously mentioned quantities. This appears to be a promising way to improve SFH recovery in external galaxies.",False,1

Unfortunately, direct measurements of ISM environments around SNe remain scarce, as SNe are rare and often distant. Here we demonstrate a new approach: mapping the ISM around the massive stars that are soon to explode. This provides a much larger census of explosion sites than possible with only SNe, and allows comparison with sensitive, high-resolution maps of the atomic and molecular gas from the Jansky VLA and ALMA. In the well-resolved Local Group spiral M33, we specifically observe the environments of red supergiants (RSGs, progenitors of Type II SNe), Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs, tracing stars $&gt;$30 M$_{\odot}$, and possibly future stripped-envelope SNe), and supernova remnants (SNRs, locations where SNe have exploded). We find that massive stars evolve not only in dense, molecular-dominated gas (with younger stars in denser gas), but also a substantial fraction ($\sim$45\% of WRs; higher for RSGs) evolve in lower-density, atomic-gas-dominated, inter-cloud media. We show that these measurements are consistent with expectations from different stellar-age tracer maps, and can be useful for validating SN feedback models in numerical simulations of galaxies. Along with the discovery of a 20-pc diameter molecular gas cavity around a WR, these findings re-emphasize the importance of pre-SN/correlated-SN feedback evacuating the dense gas around massive stars before explosion, and the need for high-resolution (down to pc-scale) surveys of the multi-phase ISM in nearby galaxies.",False,2

We present an optimized observing strategy for the DECam during O4. We base our study on simulations of gravitational-wave events expected for O4 and wide-prior kilonova simulations. We derive the detectabilities of events for realistic observing conditions. We optimize our strategy for confirming a kilonova while minimizing telescope time. For a wide range of kilonova parameters, corresponding to a fainter kilonova compared to GW170817/AT 2017gfo, we find that, with this optimal strategy, the discovery probability for electromagnetic counterparts with the DECam is ~80% at the nominal BNS gravitational-wave detection limit for O4 (190 Mpc), which corresponds to an ~30% improvement compared to the strategy adopted during the previous observing run. For more distant events (~330 Mpc), we reach an ~60% probability of detection, a factor of ~2 increase. For a brighter kilonova model dominated by the blue component that reproduces the observations of GW170817/AT 2017gfo, we find that we can reach ~90% probability of detection out to 330 Mpc, representing an increase of ~20%, while also reducing the total telescope time required to follow up events by ~20%.",False,1

The results show that the depletion of Fe and S is consistent with that found in the Milky Way (MW), LMC, and SMC. The depletion level of Fe increases with gas column density, indicating dust growth in the interstellar medium. The level of Fe depletion decreases with decreasing metallicity, resulting in the fraction of iron in gas ranging from 3% in the MW to 9% in IC 1613 and ∼19% in Sextans A.

We conduct three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a section of a galactic disc with star formation and feedback, including radiative heating from stars, a UV background, and CR feedback. We utilize the temperature phases present in our simulations to generate Cloudy models to derive spatially and temporally varying synthetic UV diagnostics. We find that radiative effects without additional heating mechanisms are not able to produce synthetic diagnostics in the observed ranges. For low CR diffusivity $\kappa _{\rm {cr}}=10^{28} \rm {cm}^2 \rm {s}^{-1}$, CR streaming heating in the outflow helps our synthetic line ratios roughly match observed ranges by producing transitional temperature gas (T ~ 10<SUP>5</SUP>-10<SUP>6</SUP> K). High CR diffusivity $\kappa _{\rm {cr}}=10^{29} \rm {cm}^2 \rm {s}^{-1}$, with or without CR streaming heating, produced transitional temperature gas.

Following corrections and improvements to this model, we calculate the apparent brightness of tumbling low-Earth orbit (LEO) debris of various sizes, and we briefly discuss the likely impact and potential mitigations of glints from space debris in LSST. We find the majority of the difference in predicted signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), about a factor of 6, arises from the defocus of LEO objects due to the large Simonyi Survey Telescope primary mirror and finite range of the debris. The largest change from the Loeb estimates is that 1–10 cm debris in LEO pose no threat to LSST transient object alert generation because their S/N for detection will be much lower than estimated by Loeb due to defocus. We find that only tumbling LEO debris larger than 10 cm or with significantly greater reflectivity, which give 1 ms glints, might be detected with high confidence (S/N &gt; 5).

We concentrated on parametric methods within the Bayesian framework, which allowed us to perform model selection between a set of different models.

The best-fitting model gives insight into the physical picture of AGN evolution, where AGN evolve differently as a function of their radio luminosity. We determined the number density, luminosity density, and kinetic luminosity density as a function of redshift, and we observed a flattening of these functions at higher redshifts, which is not present in simpler models. We explain these trends by our use of the LDDE model. Finally, we divided our sample into subsets according to the stellar mass of the host galaxies in order to investigate a possible bimodality in evolution. We found a difference in LF shape and evolution between these subsets.

Estimated internal heating rates from tidal and radiogenic sources are large enough that all planets in our study may harbor subsurface oceans, and their geological activity rates are likely to exceed the geological activity rates on Jupiter's moon Europa. Several planets are likely to experience enhanced volcanic activity rates that exceed that of Io. Owing to their relatively thin ice shells and high rates of internal heating, Proxima Cen b and LHS 1140 b are the most favorable candidates for telescopic detection of explosive, tidally driven cryovolcanism.

We present the first systematic study of 25 SNe Ic-BL—including 18 observed with the Zwicky Transient Facility and 7 from the literature—in the optical/NIR bands to determine what quantity of r-process material, if any, is synthesized in these explosions. Using semi-analytic models designed to account for r-process production in SNe Ic-BL, we perform light curve fitting to derive constraints on the r-process mass for these SNe. We also perform independent light curve fits to models without the r-process. We find that the r-process-free models are a better fit to the light curves of the objects in our sample. Thus, we find no compelling evidence of r-process enrichment in any of our objects. Further high-cadence infrared photometric studies and nebular spectroscopic analysis would be sensitive to smaller quantities of r-process ejecta mass or indicate whether all collapsars are completely devoid of r-process nucleosynthesis.",False,1

In the standard lore of binary physics, these would evolve as effectively single stars that remotely orbit one another on stationary Keplerian ellipses. However, embedded in their Galactic environment their low binding energy makes them exceptionally prone to perturbations from the gravitational potential of the Milky Way and encounters with passing stars. Employing a fully relativistic $N$-body integration scheme, we study the impact of these perturbations on the orbital evolution of wide binaries along their trajectory through the Milky Way. Our analysis reveals that the torques exerted by the Galaxy can cause large-amplitude oscillations of the binary eccentricity to $1-e\lesssim10^{-8}$. As a consequence, the wide binary members pass close to each other at periapsis, which, depending on the type of binary, potentially leads to a mass transfer or collision of stars or to an inspiral and subsequent merger of compact remnants due to gravitational-wave radiation. Based on a simulation of $10^5$ wide binaries across the Galactic field, we find that this mechanism could significantly contribute to the rate of stellar collisions and binary black hole mergers as inferred from observations of Luminous Red Novae and gravitational-wave events by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra. We conclude that the dynamics of wide binaries, despite their large mean separation, can give rise to extreme interactions between stars and compact remnants.",False,1

We show that, compared to a single star of the same final mass, a star that has undergone accretion (of non-enriched material) has a significantly different internal structure, evident in both the hydrogen abundance profile and Brunt-Väisälä frequency profile. These differences result in significant changes in the observed period spacing patterns, implying that one may use this as a diagnostic to test whether a star's core has been rejuvenated as a result of accretion. We show that it is essential to consider the full multimodal posterior distributions when fitting stellar properties of mass-gainers to avoid drawing misleading conclusions. Even with these considerations, stellar ages will be significantly underestimated when assuming single star evolution for a mass-gainer. We find that future detectors with improved uncertainties would rule out single star models with the correct mass and central hydrogen fraction.

Currently planned spectroscopic surveys will not be deep enough to produce a representative training sample for Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), so we seek methods to improve the photo-z estimates that arise from nonrepresentative training samples. Spectroscopic training samples for photo-z's are biased toward redder, brighter galaxies, which also tend to be at lower redshift than the typical galaxy observed by LSST, leading to poor photo-z estimates with outlier fractions nearly 4 times larger than for a representative training sample. In this Letter, we apply the concept of training sample augmentation, where we augment simulated nonrepresentative training samples with simulated galaxies possessing otherwise unrepresented features. When we select simulated galaxies with (g-z) color, i-band magnitude, and redshift outside the range of the original training sample, we are able to reduce the outlier fraction of the photo-z estimates for simulated LSST data by nearly 50% and the normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD) by 56%.

This phenomenon has been explained in the context of collimation by the stellar envelope, with denser (lower metallicity) stars at higher redshifts able to collimate the jet more effectively. However, until now, the dependence of the jet opening angle on the properties of the central engine has not been explored. We investigate the effect of black hole spin on the jet collimation angle for a magnetically launched jet, using the general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamical code ν bhlight. We present 3D results for a range of spin values. The simulations show that higher-spinning black holes tend to create narrower jets.

We measure the fraction of metals remaining in the interstellar medium (ISM) and CGM of each galaxy and calculate the expected mass of each SMBH based on the M <SUB>BH</SUB>–σ relation (Kormendy &amp; Ho 2013). The deviation of each SMBH from its expected mass, ΔM <SUB>BH</SUB>, is compared to the potential of its host via σ. We find that SMBHs with accreted mass above M <SUB>BH</SUB>–σ are more effective at removing metals from the ISM than undermassive SMBHs in star-forming galaxies. Overall, overmassive SMBHs suppress the total star formation of their host galaxies and more effectively move metals from the ISM into the CGM. However, we see little to no evacuation of gas from the CGM out of their halos, in contrast with other simulations. Finally, we predict that C IV column densities in the CGM of L<SUB>*</SUB> galaxies are unlikely to depend on host galaxy SMBH mass. Our results show that the scatter in the low-mass end of the M <SUB>BH</SUB>–σ relation may indicate how effective an SMBH is in the local redistribution of mass in its host galaxy.",False,2
